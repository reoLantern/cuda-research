9.7.13.12. Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: redux.sync
redux.sync

Perform reduction operation on the data from each predicated active thread in the thread group.

Syntax

redux.sync.op.type dst, src, membermask;
.op   = {.add, .min, .max}
.type = {.u32, .s32}

redux.sync.op.b32 dst, src, membermask;
.op   = {.and, .or, .xor}

redux.sync.op{.abs.}{.NaN}.f32 dst, src, membermask;
.op   = { .min, .max }
Description

redux.sync will cause the executing thread to wait until all non-exited threads corresponding to membermask have executed redux.sync with the same qualifiers and same membermask value before resuming execution.

Operand membermask specifies a 32-bit integer which is a mask indicating threads participating in this instruction where the bit position corresponds to thread’s laneid.

redux.sync performs a reduction operation .op of the 32 bit source register src across all non-exited threads in the membermask. The result of the reduction operation is written to the 32 bit destination register dst.

Reduction operation can be one of the bitwise operation in .and, .or, .xor or arithmetic operation in .add, .min , .max.

For the .add operation result is truncated to 32 bits.

For .f32 instruction type, if the input value is 0.0 then +0.0 > -0.0.

If .abs qualifier is specified, then the absolute value of the input is considered for the reduction operation.

If the .NaN qualifier is specified, then the result of the reduction operation is canonical NaN if the input to the reduction operation from any participating thread is NaN.

In the absence of .NaN qualifier, only non-NaN values are considered for the reduction operation and the result will be canonical NaN when all inputs are NaNs.

The behavior of redux.sync is undefined if the executing thread is not in the membermask.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Support for .f32 type is introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Support for .abs and .NaN qualifiers is introduced in PTX ISA version 8.6.

Target ISA Notes

Requires sm_80 or higher.

.f32 type requires sm_100a and is supported on sm_100f from PTX ISA version 8.8.

Qualifiers .abs and .NaN require sm_100a and are supported on sm_100f or higher in the same family from PTX ISA version 8.8.

Release Notes

Note that redux.sync applies to threads in a single warp, not across an entire CTA.

Examples
