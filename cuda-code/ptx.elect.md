`elect.sync`

Elect a leader thread from a set of threads.

Syntax

elect.sync d|p, membermask;

Description

`elect.sync` elects one predicated active leader thread from among a set of threads specified by `membermask`. `laneid` of the elected thread is returned in the 32-bit destination operand `d`. The sink symbol ‘_’ can be used for destination operand `d`. The predicate destination `p` is set to `True` for the leader thread, and `False` for all other threads.

Operand `membermask` specifies a 32-bit integer indicating the set of threads from which a leader is to be elected. The behavior is undefined if the executing thread is not in `membermask`.

Election of a leader thread happens deterministically, i.e. the same leader thread is elected for the same `membermask` every time.

The mandatory `.sync` qualifier indicates that `elect` causes the executing thread to wait until all threads in the `membermask` execute the `elect` instruction before resuming execution.
